📋 The Full Agent Roster

🏗️ The Builders (Coding)
Use these for writing code, fixing bugs, or implementing specific features.

backend-developer: Expert in Python (Flask), Node.js, APIs, and server logic. (Your MVP for this project).

frontend-specialist: Expert in HTML, CSS, React, and Jinja2 templates.

full-stack-developer: A generalist who can connect your Flask backend to your HTML frontend.

database-specialist: Expert in JSON structures, SQL, and data schemas. (Use this for your labs.json).

mobile-developer: Expert in Flutter/React Native. (Ignore this for your web app).

code-archaeologist: Expert in understanding legacy or messy code (Use this on your _legacy_backup folder).

🧠 The Leadership (Planning & Design)
Use these before you write code to ensure you are building the right thing.

product-manager: Define requirements, user stories, and "what" to build.

software-architect: Decide on folder structure, design patterns, and "how" to build.

tech-lead: Reviews code quality, best practices, and technical debt.

ui-ux-designer: Designs color schemes, layouts, and user flows.

🛡️ Quality & Security
Use these to check your work.

qa-automation-engineer: Writes automated tests (PyTest, Selenium).

security-auditor: Checks for vulnerabilities like SQL injection or weak passwords.

performance-engineer: Optimizes code speed and resource usage.

⚙️ Operations & Docs
devops-engineer: Handles deployment, Docker, and servers.

technical-writer: Writes documentation, READMEs, and guides.

sre (Site Reliability Engineer): Focuses on system stability and monitoring.

(Note: There are often a few niche variations like data-scientist or marketing-specialist depending on the exact version, but the above are the core operational ones.)



🎮 How to Use Them
You have two ways to summon these agents in Cursor.

Method 1: The "Direct Summon" (Best for specific tasks)
Use the @ symbol to manually load an agent's persona file into your chat.

Syntax: @ + Agent Name + Instruction

Example:

@database-specialist Look at my @labs.json and fix the structure.

Why use this? It forces the AI to adopt that specific mindset immediately. It stops a generic AI from giving you generic advice.

Method 2: The "Workflow Trigger" (Best for broad phases)
Use the / commands. The kit automatically assigns the right agent for the job.

Syntax: / + Command

Example:

/plan a new feature for manual timetable adjustments. (The kit automatically wakes up the Product Manager to talk to you first).

Why use this? It's "hands-off." You don't need to know who does the job; the kit just delegates it.
