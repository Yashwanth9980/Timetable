Based on the Antigravity Kit documentation, here is the complete list of 11 workflow commands you can use. I have categorized them to help you understand when to use each one.

🧠 Phase 1: Planning & Strategy
/brainstorm - "The Explorer"

Use when: You have a vague idea (e.g., "I need a way to handle lab clashes") but don't know the best solution. It lists options before you code.

/plan - "The Architect"

Use when: You know what you want but need a to-do list. It breaks a feature down into step-by-step tasks for a developer.

/status - "The Auditor"

Use when: You want a health check on your project (like the report we just generated).

🛠️ Phase 2: Building & Coding
/create - "The Builder"

Use when: You are starting a new file or feature from scratch (e.g., "Create the Subject class").

/enhance - "The Improver"

Use when: You have code that works but needs to be better (cleaner, faster, or more secure).

/ui-ux-pro-max - "The Designer"

Use when: You need CSS or HTML designs. It triggers a "Design Expert" to give you polished UI code.

🐛 Phase 3: Quality Control
/debug - "The Detective"

Use when: Something is broken. It forces a systematic root-cause analysis instead of random guessing.

/test - "The Quality Assurance"

Use when: You want to write unit tests to ensure your code doesn't break in the future.

🚀 Phase 4: Operations & Complex Tasks
/preview - "The Simulator"

Use when: You want to check if the app runs locally (mostly useful for web apps).

/deploy - "The Shipper"

Use when: You are ready to put the app on the internet (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a server).

/orchestrate - "The Manager"

Use when: You have a massive task that needs multiple agents (e.g., "Plan backend, then Design frontend, then Write tests"). Note: This is often overkill for small projects.
