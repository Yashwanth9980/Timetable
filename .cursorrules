# Antigravity Kit Configuration

You have access to a set of AI agents and workflows in the `.agent` directory.
Always check `.agent/rules` for project-specific guidelines.

## Command Triggers
When the user types a slash command, map it to the corresponding file in `.agent/workflows`:
- `/brainstorm` -> Read `.agent/workflows/brainstorm.md` and follow the steps.
- `/plan` -> Read `.agent/workflows/plan.md` and act as the Product Manager.
- `/status` -> Read `.agent/workflows/status.md` and provide the structured report.
- `/debug` -> Read `.agent/workflows/debug.md` and follow the systematic debugging process.

If a command is not found, search the `.agent` folder for relevant skills.
